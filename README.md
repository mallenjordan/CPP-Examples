# CPP Examples

Here are a few examples of programming using c++

## Current files / uses

- addThemInts.cpp (08/07/2019)
```
This is a function that accepts a array of integers.
Returns the Sum (addition) of the array.
If there is any integer overflow it returns 0(Zero) and displays an error.
```

- Permutations.cpp (08/09/2019)
```
This is some fun and can cause problems.
A permutation recursive function.
Showing all possible mixing of the string passed.
It is exponential, so be careful.
(Not just the function calls, but variables and loops are also)
'matthew' took a while and was around 3720 permutations
but that did not count the matching multiples that were removed.
```

- linkedLists.cpp (08/10/2019)
```
Playing with some linked lists.
This one took me a bit longer than I expected.
4 hours start to finish.
A lot of testing and getting the addresses accurate.

It has everything, pushing, poping, looping, swap, indexing.
I will use it in a future examples I do believe, yes.
```
